SMERF - Simple MEta Rails Form Plugin Generator
===============================================

A. Completing the Installation
------------------------------

1. Run the DB migration

rake db:migrate

2. Set the record ID of the current user so that SMERF can save responses 
for each user. This can normally be done once the user has been authenticated 
by using the following code as an example:

SmerfForm.smerf_user_id = current_user.id

3. You can use the example stylesheet(smerf.css) supplied with the plugin 
which was copied to the /public/stylesheets directory by adding it to your 
application layout, e.g.

<%= stylesheet_link_tag "smerf", :cache => true  %>

4. To create a link to display a form you can use the Standard REST Path 
method used for the show action passing the name of the form definition file
as a parameter, for example

link_to('Complete Test Smerf Form', smerf_url('testsmerf'))

B. Testing your installation
----------------------------

To test the installation you can display the test form by doing something 
like this:

1. Set the SMERF user ID in the application.rb file for example to the ID
of an existing user record, e.g. 

# Set the record ID for the user accessing smerf, normally this would be done
# once the user has been authenticated
SmerfForm.smerf_user_id = 1

2. Display the SMERF test form by doing something similar to this

http://localhost:3000/smerf_test
