# This class contains details about form questions, it derives from
# SmerfItem.
# 
# A group can contain any number of questions, there must be at least one question 
# per group. When defining a question you must specify the question type, 
# the type determines the type of form field that will be created. 
# There are currently four types that can be used, this will be expanded as 
# needed. The current question types are:
#
# multiplechoice:: Allows the user to select all of the answers that apply from a 
#                  list of possible choices, check boxes are used for this question 
#                  type as multiple selections can be made 
# singlechoice:: Allows the user to select one answer from a list of possible choices, 
#                radio buttons are used for the question type as only a single answer 
#                can be selected 
# textbox:: Allows the user to enter a large amount of free text, the size of the 
#           text box can be specified 
# textfield:: Allows the user to enter a small amount of free form text, the size 
#             of the text field can be specified 
# 
# The following fields can be used to define a question:
# 
# code:: Unique code that will identify the question, the code must be unique within 
#        a form (mandatory) 
# type:: Specifies the type of field that should be constructed on the form for 
#        this question, see above list for current types (mandatory) 
# question:: The text of the question, this field is optional as subquestions do 
#            not have to have question text 
# textbox_size:: Specifies the size of the text box to construct, rows x cols, 
#                defaults to 30x5 (optional) 
# textfield_size:: Specified the size of the text field that should be constructed, 
#                  specified in the number of visible characters, default to 30 (optional) 
# header:: Specifies a separate heading for the question. The text will be 
#          displayed above the question allowing questions to be broken up into 
#          subsections (optional) 
# sort_order:: Specifies the sort order for the question 
# help:: Help text that will be displayed below the question 
# answers:: Defines the answers to the question if the question type displays a 
#           list of possibilities to the user 
# validation:: Specifies the validation methods (comma separated) that should be 
#              executed for this question, see Validation and Errors section for 
#              more details
#  
# Below is an example question definition:
# 
#       questions:
#         specify_your_age:
#           code: g1q1
#           type: singlechoice
#           sort_order: 1
#           question: | Specify your ages  
#           help: | Select the <b>one</b> that apply 
#           validation: validate_mandatory_question
#           ...
