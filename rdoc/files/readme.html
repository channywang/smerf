      <h1>Simple MEta Rails Form (SMERF)</h1>
<p>
SMERF is a Ruby on Rails plugin that allows you to easily define dynamic
forms which you can use for surveys, questionnaires, and data collection
forms for example. It records which forms a user have completed and saves
the users responses so that they can easily be analysed via SQL.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li>You need to have a table that stores details about the users of your
application. SMERF will keep track of the forms a user completes as well as
the users responses to questions on these forms.

</li>
<li>The name of this users table as well as the primary key and model needs to
conform to the Rails convention, i.e.

<pre>
 - DB table name needs to be plural, e.g. users
 - Primary key assumed to be named id
 - Model name is singular of the DB table, e.g. user
</pre>
</li>
<li>SMERF is a RESTful plugin

</li>
<li>It has only been tested with Rails V2

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Download</h2>
<h3>Direct Download</h3>
<pre>
    Get it from RubyForge at http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=5260
</pre>
<h3>Using Rails Plugin Installer</h3>
<pre>
    ruby script/plugin install http://smerf.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/CURRENT/smerf
</pre>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
The plugin is easy to install, once you have downloaded the source code run
the following command from the root directory of your Rails application
</p>
<pre>
    ./script/generate smerf UserModelName
</pre>
<p>
Replace UserModelName with the model you use for storing details about your
applications users, for example
</p>
<pre>
    ./script/generate smerf user
</pre>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ol>
<li>Run the DB migration

<pre>
 rake db:migrate
</pre>
</li>
<li>Set the record ID of the current user so that SMERF can save responses for
each user. This can normally be done once the user has been authenticated
by using the following code as an example:

<pre>
 SmerfForm.smerf_user_id = current_user.id
</pre>
</li>
<li>You can use the example stylesheet(smerf.css) supplied with the plugin
which was copied to the /public/stylesheets directory by adding it to your
application layout, e.g.

<pre>
 &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &quot;smerf&quot;, :cache =&gt; true  %&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>To create a link to display a form you can use the Standard REST Path
method used for the show action passing the name of the form definition
file as a parameter, for example

<pre>
 link_to('Complete Test Smerf Form', smerf_url('testsmerf'))
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Testing your installation</h2>
<p>
To test the installation you can display the test form by doing something
like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the SMERF user ID in the application.rb file. For example set the SMERF
user ID to the ID of an existing user record, e.g.

<pre>
 # Set the record ID for the user accessing smerf, normally this would be done
 # once the user has been authenticated
 SmerfForm.smerf_user_id = 1
</pre>
</li>
<li>Display the SMERF test form by doing something similar to this

<pre>
 http://localhost:3000/smerf_test
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
The SMERF form definition file allows you to define the contents of a form.
Each form is made up of groups and within each group there are any number
of questions which can accept free form text as the answer or presents a
list of possibilties to the user.
</p>
<p>
In some cases an answer may ask for additional information by asking
another questions, these can be defined using the subquestion field when
defining the answer. Subquestion fields are defined using exactly the same
fields as a normal question, you can nest subquestions to any level. An
example subquestion may be for the answer &#8216;Other&#8217;, in some
cases additional information is required when the user selects this answer,
a subquestion can be defined to accept free form text where the user can
add additional information.
</p>
<h3>Form Definition File</h3>
<p>
To create a new form we define the content of the form using a YAML file. I
decided to use YAML as it seems to be the defacto standard for Rails, its
simple and has a nice hierarchical structure which suits the way forms are
structured. At a later date I or someone else may develop a web based form
definition interface. All form definition files are assumed to be located
in the /smerf directory.
</p>
<p>
The definitions within the file is space sensitive, be very careful to get
this correct otherwise items will be grouped incorrectly. The structure
must be as follows with items at the following levels:
</p>
<pre>
    smerfform
        groups
            questions
                answers
</pre>
<p>
<em>The name of the form definition file is used to identify the form.</em>
If you change the name of the file then a new DB record will be created
with the new code and all links to any history will be lost as this will be
treated as a brand new form. When the system loads the form file for the
very first time a new record will be created with a code that is set to the
name of the file.
</p>
<p>
To create a link to display a form you can use the Standard REST Path
method used for the show action passing the name of the form definition
file as a parameter, for example
</p>
<p>
link_to(&#8216;Complete Test Smerf Form&#8217;,
smerf_url(&#8216;testsmerf&#8217;))
</p>
<h3>Defining the Form</h3>
<p>
When setting up a new form the first thing we do is define some settings
for the form as a whole. Currently the following items can be defined for
the form:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">name:</td><td>Name of the form (mandatory)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">welcome:</td><td>Message displayed at the start of the form (optional)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">thank_you:</td><td>Message displayed at the end of the form (optional)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">group_sort_order_field:</td><td>Nominates which group field to use when sorting groups for display
(mandatory)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">groups:</td><td>Defines the question groups within the form (mandatory)

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Here is the definition for the test form included with the plugin:
</p>
<pre>
    ---
    smerfform:
      name: Test SMERF Form
      welcome: |
        &lt;b&gt;Welcome:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        February 2007
      group_sort_order_field: code

      groups:
      ...
</pre>
<h3>Defining Groups</h3>
<p>
Each form is divided up into groups of questions, you must have at least
one group per form. Here are the fields that are currently available when
defining a group:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">code:</td><td>This code must be unique for all groups within the form as it is used to
identify each group (mandatory)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">name:</td><td>The name of the group, this is displayed as the group heading (mandatory)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">description:</td><td>Provide more detailed description/instructions for the group (optional)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">questions:</td><td>Defines all the questions contained within this group (mandatory)

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Here is the definition for the Personal Details group of the test form:
</p>
<pre>
    personal_details:
      code: 1
      name: Personal Details Group
      description: | This is a brief description of the Personal Details Group
        here we ask you some personal details ...
      questions:
      ...
</pre>
<h3>Defining Questions</h3>
<p>
A group can contain any number of questions, there must be at least one
question per group. When defining a question you must specify the question
type, the type determines the type of form field that will be created.
There are currently four types that can be used, this will be expanded as
needed. The current question types are:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">multiplechoice:</td><td>Allows the user to select all of the answers that apply from a list of
possible choices, check boxes are used for this question type as multiple
selections can be made

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">singlechoice:</td><td>Allows the user to select one answer from a list of possible choices, radio
buttons are used for the question type as only a single answer can be
selected

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">textbox:</td><td>Allows the user to enter a large amount of free text, the size of the text
box can be specified

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">textfield:</td><td>Allows the user to enter a small amount of free form text, the size of the
text field can be specified

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">selectionbox:</td><td>Allows the user to select one or more answers from a dropdown list of
possible choices

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The following fields can be used to define a question:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">code:</td><td>Unique code that will identify the question, the code must be unique within
a form (mandatory)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">type:</td><td>Specifies the type of field that should be constructed on the form for this
question, see above list for current types (mandatory)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">question:</td><td>The text of the question, this field is optional as subquestions do not
have to have question text

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">textbox_size:</td><td>Specifies the size of the text box to construct, rows x cols, defaults to
30x5 (optional)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">textfield_size:</td><td>Specified the size of the text field that should be constructed, specified
in the number of visible characters, default to 30 (optional)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">header:</td><td>Specifies a separate heading for the question. The text will be displayed
above the question allowing questions to be broken up into subsections
(optional)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">sort_order:</td><td>Specifies the sort order for the question

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">help:</td><td>Help text that will be displayed below the question

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">answers:</td><td>Defines the answers to the question if the question type displays a list of
possibilities to the user

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">validation:</td><td>Specifies the validation methods (comma separated) that should be executed
for this question, see Validation and Errors section for more details

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">selectionbox_multiplechoice:</td><td>Specifies if the selection box should allow multiple choices

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Below is an example question definition:
</p>
<pre>
      questions:
        specify_your_age:
          code: g1q1
          type: singlechoice
          sort_order: 1
          question: | Specify your ages
          help: | Select the &lt;b&gt;one&lt;/b&gt; that apply
          validation: validate_mandatory_question
          ...
</pre>
<h3>Defining Answers</h3>
<p>
If the question presents a list of possible answers to the user then we can
easily define these answers by using the following fields:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">code:</td><td>Code to uniquely identify the answer, code needs to be unique for each
question (mandatory). The value specified here will be saved as the users
response when the answer is selected.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">answer:</td><td>The text that will be displayed to the user (mandatory)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">default:</td><td>If set to Y then this answer will be selected by default (optional)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">sort_order:</td><td>The sort order for this answer (mandatory)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">subquestions:</td><td>Some answers may need additional information, another question can be
defined to obtain this information. To define a subquestion the same fields
that define a normal question is used (optional)

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Here is an example answer definition:
</p>
<pre>
      answers:
        1_20:
          code: 1
          answer: | 1-20
          sort_order: 1
          default: N
          ...
</pre>
<h3>Defining Subquestions</h3>
<p>
Additional questions can be defined for an answer if more information is
required if the user selects the answer. For example you may have an answer
&#8216;Other&#8217; that requires additional information from the user. A
subquestion can be defined for the &#8216;Other&#8217; answer that takes an
additional input from the user. To define a subquestion you use the same
fields as for a normal question (Refer to the Defining Question section
above).
</p>
<p>
Below is an example subquestion definition:
</p>
<pre>
      subquestions:
        other_industries:
            code: g1q3a4s1
            type: textbox
            sort_order: 1
            question:
            help: | Please specify
            textbox_size: 30x3
            validation: validate_sub_question
            ...
</pre>
<h3>Data Store</h3>
<p>
There are three tables used by SMERF:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">smerf_forms:</td><td>contains details about each form

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">smerf_forms_users:</td><td>contains a record for each of the forms a user completes

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">smerf_responses:</td><td>contains a record for each response given to each question on the form.
This allows analysis of answers via SQL queries.

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
When a user selects to view a form the system checks the form definition
file to see if any changes have been made since the last time the form was
loaded, if it has the form definition file is processed and validated. A
set of classes and objects are created that describes the form including <a
href="../classes/SmerfFile.html">SmerfFile</a>, <a
href="../classes/SmerfGroup.html">SmerfGroup</a>, <a
href="../classes/SmerfQuestion.html">SmerfQuestion</a>, <a
href="../classes/SmerfAnswer.html">SmerfAnswer</a>, these are serialized to
YAML format and stored in a single database field within the smerf_forms
table. If no changes have been made to the definition file then the form is
simply read from the smerf_forms table and unserialized from YAML with all
classes and objects reconstructed.
</p>
<p>
The users responses to questions on a form are stored in the
smerf_responses table which stores a separate record for each response to a
question. If a question has multiple answers then multiple records will be
created for the question. Responses for a question can be found by using
the unique question code assigned within the form definition file. So for
example if we had a question with code &#8216;g1q1&#8217; and the user
selects two answers which have been assigned code values 3 and 5 then two
records will be created, i.e.
</p>
<pre>
    g1q1, 3
    g1q1, 5
</pre>
<p>
Check your DB or the migration file to see the table and column definitions
for each table.
</p>
<h3>Validation and Errors</h3>
<p>
All validations are specified as part of the question (or subquestion)
definition using the &#8216;validation:&#8217; field. The SMERF validation
system is very flexible and allows any number of validation methods to be
specified for a question by comma separating each method.
</p>
<pre>
    validation: validate_mandatory_question, validate_years
</pre>
<p>
Currently there are two validation methods provided with the plugin:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">validate_mandatory_question:</td><td>This method will ensure that the user has answered the question

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">validate_sub_question:</td><td>Only applies to subquestions and makes sure that the user has selected the
answer that relates to the subquestion, it will also ensure the subquestion
has been answered if the answer that relates to the subquestion has been
selected.

</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
SMERF also allows you to define your own custom validation methods. During
the installation process SMERF creates a helper module called
smerf_helpers.rb in the /lib directory. You can add new validation methods
into this module and access them by simply referencing them in the form
definition file. For example we have question &#8216;How many years have
you worked in the industry&#8217; and we want to ensure that the answer
provided is between 0-99 we can create a new validation method called
&#8216;validate_years&#8217;.
</p>
<pre>
  # Example validation method for &quot;How many years have you worked in the industry&quot;
  # it uses a regex to make sure 0-99 years specified.
  #
  def validate_years(question, responses, form)
    # Validate entry and make sure years are numeric and between 0-99
    answer = smerf_get_question_answer(question, responses)
    if (answer)
      # Expression will return nil if regex fail, also check charcters
      # after the match to determine if &gt; 2 numbers specified
      res = (&quot;#{answer}&quot; =~ /\d{1,2}/)
      return &quot;Years must be between 0 and 99&quot; if (!res or $'.length() &gt; 0)
    end

    return nil
  end
</pre>
<p>
Note: There are some helper methods that you can use within these methods
included in the smerf_system_helpers.rb module which you can find in the
plugins lib directory.
</p>
<p>
Your question definition may then look like this:
</p>
<pre>
    how_many_years:
      code: g2q3
      type: textfield
      sort_order: 3
      header:
      question: | How many years have you worked in the industry
      textfield_size: 10
      validation: validate_mandatory_question, validate_years
      help:
</pre>
<p>
When the form is validated your custom validation method will be called.
When an error is detected, a summary of the errors are displayed at the top
of the form, additionally an error message is displayed for each question
that has an error. This makes it very easy for the user to see which
question they need to fix.
</p>
